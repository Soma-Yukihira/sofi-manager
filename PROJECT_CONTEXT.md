# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

Architectural and operational context for Selfbot Manager.

## What it is

A desktop application (GUI + CLI) that orchestrates multiple Discord
SOFI selfbots in parallel. Each bot runs in its own thread with its own
asyncio loop, sharing a common config file (`bots.json`) and theme
(`settings.json`).

- **GUI:** `main.py` → `gui.py` (CustomTkinter, black & gold theme,
  17-slot color customization, dark / light presets).
- **CLI:** `cli.py` for headless / VPS use; shares the same core as the
  GUI.
- **Core:** `bot_core.py` defines the `SelfBot` class — SOFI message
  parsing (FR + EN), rarity / popularity scoring, wishlist override,
  randomized night-pause window.
- **Updater:** `updater.py` ships continuous updates from `origin/main`
  via `git fetch` + `git pull --ff-only`, surfaced in the GUI as a
  non-blocking gold banner.

```

Per-user state created at first launch (gitignored):

- `bots.json` — bot tokens + per-bot config (tokens are Fernet-encrypted
  with a key kept in the OS keyring; see [crypto.py](crypto.py))
- `settings.json` — theme mode + 17-slot color customization
- `grabs.db` — SQLite history (WAL). Override with `SOFI_DB_PATH`.
- `Selfbot Manager.lnk` — Windows taskbar shortcut

The encryption key lives in the OS keyring under
`service="sofi-manager"`, falling back to `<USER_DATA>/key`
(`%APPDATA%/sofi-manager/` on Windows, `~/.config/sofi-manager/` on
POSIX). Pre-existing plaintext `bots.json` files keep working — the
first save after upgrade rewrites every token as ciphertext. Restoring
`bots.json` from a backup on a different machine without also restoring
the key will surface a clear error rather than silently corrupting
state.

## Build system

[`tools/build.py`](tools/build.py) drives
[`selfbot-manager.spec`](selfbot-manager.spec) — the spec is the
single source of truth. `customtkinter` data, `curl_cffi` native libs
and `_cffi_backend` are bundled there because PyInstaller's module
graph doesn't pick them up on its own.

Modes, output layout and antivirus notes: see
[Building](docs/wiki/Building.md).

## Update model

No release artifacts. Every commit on `main` is what users run, the
moment it lands.

### Why this design

- One source of truth (the git graph), zero manual steps between
  merging and shipping.
- No version-bump dance, no tag-vs-`__version__` drift to police.
- A fast-forward `git pull` plus a re-exec is atomic enough for a
  desktop side-project.

### Safety rails

The git-pull path **refuses to touch the tree** when:

- The current branch is not `main`.
- `git rev-list @{u}..HEAD` > 0 (local commits ahead — would force a
  merge).
- `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` is non-empty (local
  modifications to tracked files — risk of conflict).

The `.git/`-absent case is no longer a no-op: `apply_zip_update`
fetches `codeload.github.com/<repo>/zip/refs/heads/main`, validates it
(zip-slip guard, strict SHA baseline persisted as `zip_install_sha`
in `settings.json`), and overwrites tracked files in place. Frozen
`.exe` is the only structurally un-updatable case — it surfaces an
amber banner via `_maybe_show_skip_reason_banner` pointing at a
rebuild.

`bots.json`, `settings.json` and `grabs.db` are gitignored, so they
always survive.

User-facing flow (banner copy, restart sequence, codeload details,
`tools/update.py` CLI alternative): see
[Updating](docs/wiki/Updating.md).

## Git hygiene

`.gitignore` enforces the credentials, build-output, venv and cache
exclusions. The authoritative list of "never commit" patterns lives in
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Workflow: feature branch → PR → squash-merge
into `main`. Every push to `main` is auto-shipped to users.
